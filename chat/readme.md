Notes; the port the system is on is allocated to 1201 (change if you wish) & of course the ip is localhost. 
For future development I was a more personalised experience because at the moment each player is labeled as a client and nothing,
warwick and james are working on ID's at the moment and once theyve completed that i will make a function that requests ID and assigns
a username chosen by the user to that ID.

A standalone chat system was created because it gives us more flexability for the future. Things like anti spam control will hopefully be implemented,
and chat filter also.
